- In the new method it would be nice if I could confirm they really are 
  format or gre strings!

ISODate

- I could easily add the ability to assign start,mid,end so each month of
  the year has a unique name in terms of quarter. eg mid-Q1

- TO BE IMPLIMENTED:
  June 21 or 22 summer solstice
  Sept 22 or 23 autumnal equinox
  Dec 21 or 22   winter solstice
  March 20 or 21 vernal or spring equinox

- new_formatted class method. This is a good place to use Time::ParseDate
  [DMA 20021207 - ?]

- new_formatted class method. There is no way to specify utc here
  [DMA 20021207 - ?]

- new_formatted class method. PERHAPS ADD A date only new function for
  format {Y...}MMDD
  [DMA 20021207 - ?]

- Class methods SHORTCOMINGS: perhaps add a date only new method; no
  way to specify UTC even if you know it.
  [DMA 20021207 - ?]

- Class methods. There is currently not sufficient bounds checking of 
  dates to make sure they are possible dates.

- I may wish to rewrite parts of this Class to use lazy evaluation.
  [DMA 20021207 - ?]

- I need to support the ISO 8601 week numbering
  [DMA 20021207 - ?]

- I may in the future want to add the ability to translate dates from 
  my address book and logs from the US 2 digit year format (mm/dd/yy)
  to the International Date Format with 4 digit year I have now 
  standardized on.
  [DMA 20021207 - ?]

- These values are not checked for limits or that the day of the month
  exists in that month and year.
    ($havedate,$havetime,$y2k,
     $yr,$mon,$day,$hr,$min,$sec) = $self->_isodate($str);
  Later on fill this in so it handles other formats
    if (!$havedate) {return undef;}
  [DMA 20021207 - ?]

- DMALIB: the standard package HTTP::Date has str2iso and
  iso2str methods which might be useable to simplify my
  own Date object.
